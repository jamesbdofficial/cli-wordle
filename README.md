A wordle clone created in Rust, this was my first project in this language.

Runs through the command line, the program chooses a new word from its preset list using the "rand" crate, and stores the users scores in a text file whenever they beat the game.
The user can view their scores by typing "scores" in the main menu, and it will print out how many guesses it took, and the date and time of when they beat the game.

Game in action: <br/>
